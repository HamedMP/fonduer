href="./Scots-Irish_American">Scots-Irish</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for <a class="link" href="./First_Interstate_BancSystem">First Interstate BancSystem</a> and the <a class="link" href="./United_Way_of_America">United Way</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates' maternal grandfather was J.W, Maxwell, a <a class="link" href="./National_bank#United States">national bank</a> president.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates has one older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and a younger sister, Libby.</span> <span class="sentence">He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.</span> <span class="sentence">Early on in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career.</span> <span class="sentence">When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the <a class="link" href="./Congregational_Christian_Churches">Congregational Christian Churches</a>, a <a class="link" href="./Protestant">Protestant</a> <a class="link" href="./Reformed">Reformed</a> denomination.</span> <span class="sentence">The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was <a class="link" href="./Hearts">hearts</a> or <a class="link" href="./Pickleball">pickleball</a> or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".</span> <span class="sentence">At 13, he enrolled in the <a class="link" href="./Lakeside_School_(Seattle,_Washington)">Lakeside School</a>, a private preparatory school.</span> <span class="sentence">When Gates was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's <a class="link" href="./Rummage_sale">rummage sale</a> to buy a <a class="link" href="./Teletype_Model_33">Teletype Model 33</a> ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a <a class="link" href="./General_Electric">General Electric</a> (GE) computer for the school's students.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in <a class="link" href="./BASIC_programming_language">BASIC</a>, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest.</span> <span class="sentence">He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of <a class="link" href="./Tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe</a> that allowed users to play games against the computer.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.</span> <span class="sentence">When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine."</span> <span class="sentence">After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including <a class="link" href="./Digital_Equipment_Corporation">DEC</a> <a class="link" href="./Programmed_Data_Processor">PDP</a> minicomputers.</span> <span class="sentence">One of these systems was a <a class="link" href="./PDP-10">PDP-10</a> belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students Gates, <a class="link" href="./Paul_Allen">Paul Allen</a>, <a class="link" href="./Ric_Weiland">Ric Weiland</a>, and Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.</span> <span class="sentence">At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in <a class="link" href="./Computer_Center_Corporation">CCC's</a> software in exchange for extra computer time.</span> <span class="sentence">Rather than use the system via <a class="link" href="./Teletype">Teletype</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied <a class="link" href="./Source_code">source code</a> for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in <a class="link" href="./Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a class="link" href="./Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a>, and <a class="link" href="./Machine_language">machine language</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business.</span> <span class="sentence">The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in <a class="link" href="./COBOL">COBOL</a>, providing them computer time and royalties.</span> <span class="sentence">After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes.</span> <span class="sentence">He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls."</span> <span class="sentence">He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."</span> <span class="sentence">At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called <a class="link" href="./Traf-O-Data">Traf-O-Data</a>, to make <a class="link" href="./Traffic_counter">traffic counter</a>s based on the <a class="link" href="./Intel_8008">Intel 8008</a> processor.</span> <span class="sentence">In 1972, Bill Gates served as a congressional <a class="link" href="./Page_(assistance_occupation)">page</a> in the <a class="link" href="./U.S._House_of_Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates was a <a class="link" href="./National_Merit_Scholarship_Program">National Merit Scholar</a> when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.</span> <span class="sentence">He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the <a class="link" href="./SAT">Scholastic Aptitude Tests</a> (SAT) and enrolled at <a class="link" href="./Harvard_College">Harvard College</a> in the autumn of 1973.</span> <span class="sentence">He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.</span> <span class="sentence">While at Harvard, he met fellow student <a class="link" href="./Steve_Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate <a class="link" href="./Magna_cum_laude"><i>magna cum laude</i></a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO.</span> <span class="sentence">He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.</span> <span class="sentence">In his second year, Gates devised an <a class="link" href="./Algorithm">algorithm</a> for <a class="link" href="./Pancake_sorting">pancake sorting</a> as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a <a class="link" href="./Combinatorics">combinatorics</a> class by <a class="link" href="./Harry_R._Lewis">Harry Lewis</a>, one of his professors.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years; its successor is faster by only one percent.</span> <span class="sentence">His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist <a class="link" href="./Christos_Papadimitriou">Christos Papadimitriou</a>.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at Harvard, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at <a class="link" href="./Honeywell">Honeywell</a> during the summer of 1974.</span> <span class="sentence">The <a class="link" href="./MITS_Altair_8800">MITS Altair 8800</a> was released the following year.</span> <span class="sentence">The new computer was based on the <a class="link" href="./Intel_8080_CPU">Intel 8080 CPU</a>, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time.</span> <span class="sentence">He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company.</span> <span class="sentence">Gates explained his decision to <a class="link" href="./Leave_of_absence">leave</a> Harvard, saying "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] leave [of absence]."</span>

    <span class="sentence">From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy.</span> <span class="sentence">He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."</span> <span class="sentence">Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times.</span> <span class="sentence">When they met again a month later, Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it.
